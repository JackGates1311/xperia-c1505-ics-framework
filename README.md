## üìù Conclusion

```plaintext
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: 

I do not recommend patching **framework-res.apk** anyway, if it is possible to avoid that. 

Better approach is to adopt other System apps (Settings, SystemUI, ...) to match existing **framework-res.apk**
```

But using Apktool and Smali/Baksmali, you can decompile, modify, and rebuild (**not tested**) the framework-res app for the Xperia E (C1505) based on the Xperia E dual‚Äôs Android 4.0.4 firmware.
